Hi, I’m Meher Karthik! I’m currently persuing Engineering.
I’m learning how to use AI to solve real-world problems and make life easier in small but meaningful ways.
My background is in electronics and communication, so working with AI feels like a natural step forward. I enjoy exploring how technology can think, learn, and adapt to help us in everyday tasks.
